The use of regression analysis to model the likelihood of households to purchase a motorcycle allows for highly targeted marketing, decreasing marketing expenses. Additionally, the price of motorcycle purchased by a household depending on their monthly expenditure is also modelled.

The motorcycle is a major method of transportation in India, the largest motorcycle market in the world, owing to its high fuel efficiency, low maintenance costs, and ease of use. In fact, data shows that most workers in Indian cities primarily use motorcycles to commute and travel for work.

However, growing up I noticed motorcycles are often unaffordable to many people – such as construction and delivery workers – who instead commute on foot or by bicycle which hurts their productivity and is physically grueling. I realized that if motorcycles were more affordable, more people could access them which improves their productivity and quality of life. Researching further, I found marketing costs were a significant source of expenditure for motorcycle manufacturers. Thus, if these costs were reduced, motorcycles could be sold at lower prices.

Therefore, having a keen interest in the application of statistical models, I decided to explore the use of regression analysis in modelling the likelihood of households to purchase motorcycles. This was done by training a program by logistic regression. This allows for highly targeted marketing, which is more cost efficient, decreasing marketing expenses. Additionally, the price of motorcycle purchased by a household depending on their monthly expenditure is also modelled. This was done by training a program by linear regression.
